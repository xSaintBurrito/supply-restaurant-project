# supply-restaurant-project

A simple REST API created using dash in python. 
Dash is a flask-based package that allows for easy frontend creation. 
Html and css objects are simply made and called.

This restaurant API is supposed to be connected to its own database of items currently found in the restaurant.
Next, It should have two endpoints - a get groceries and send orders endpoints.
It should connect to the supplier API in order to send them orders and receive items from them.
